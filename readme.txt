Welcome to my second NodeJS code
Here I have tried to check whether the user selected a home page (http://localhost:8000) or another page (like this http://localhost:8000/login)
using hash table
1. Create a JavaScript page (app.js)
2. Create an html page (index.html)
3. Create another html page (as an example login.html)
4. Create a communication between the two pages (using protocol=”http” and port number  8000) and check whether the user requested the home page or any other page
5. If the user requests any other page other than the above two, then redirect to homepage
